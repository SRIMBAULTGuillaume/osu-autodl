OSU! auto map downloader
=====

This is a (very) small extension to download automatically osu!'s beatmaps.

The beatmaps are dowloaded in your download folder in a subfolder called by an original name: 'osu'.

This extension was created to work on Mozilla Firefox and Linux.

A little script automatically transfert downloaded beatmaps into osu's folder. 
Please edit yourself the bash script to make it match to your folder config.

Build the extension with :
```shell
mkdir build
zip -r -FS build/osu-autodl.zip *
```
